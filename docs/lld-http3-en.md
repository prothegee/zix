# LLD: zix.Http3

Internal implementation details for the HTTP/3 (QUIC) layer. For design rationale see [`docs/hld-http3-en.md`](hld-http3-en.md).

The engine is layered, and each file's `//!` doc comment tags its layer: C (crypto bottom), Q (QUIC transport), T (TLS-over-QUIC glue), P (QPACK), L (loss recovery), H (HTTP/3 semantics). Every deterministic module is proven byte-exact against the RFC worked examples in its in-file tests.

---

## Layer C: crypto.zig

The deterministic crypto bottom of the QUIC stack (RFC 9001). Pure functions plus one usage-accounting struct, no connection state.

- `initial_salt` (RFC 9001 5.2) and `initialSecrets(dcid)`: HKDF-Extract(salt, ikm=dcid), then `expandLabel` with `"client in"` / `"server in"` to split the client and server Initial secrets.
- `expandLabel(out, secret, label, context)`: the TLS 1.3 HKDF-Expand-Label form (RFC 8446 7.1), the `"tls13 "` prefix plus the label.
- `AesKeys { key: [16]u8, iv: [12]u8, hp: [16]u8 }` with `fromSecret`: derives the packet key, IV, and header-protection key via the `"quic key"` / `"quic iv"` / `"quic hp"` labels (RFC 9001 5.1). `ChaChaKeys` is the wider ChaCha20 sibling (implemented, not wired).
- `aeadNonce(iv, packet_number)`: XOR the packet number into the low bytes of the IV (RFC 9001 5.3).
- `headerMaskAes(hp, sample)`: the header-protection mask, AES-ECB(hp, sample) (RFC 9001 5.4.1). `headerMaskChaCha` is the ChaCha20 form (not wired).
- Deferred but tested: `retryTag` / `retryKeyNonce` (Retry integrity, RFC 9001 5.8), `nextKeyUpdateSecret` (key ratchet, 6.1), `KeyUsage` with `confidentialityLimit` / `integrityLimit` (AEAD usage limits, 6.6).

The live path is AES-128-GCM only.

---

## Layer Q: the QUIC transport

### varint.zig

QUIC variable-length integers (RFC 9000 section 16). The top two bits of the first byte give the base-2 log of the length (1 / 2 / 4 / 8 bytes), the rest is the value in network order.

- `Varint { value: u64, len: usize }`, `read(data)` decodes, `write(out, value)` encodes at the minimal length (`encodedLen` picks it), setting the `0x00` / `0x40` / `0x80` / `0xc0` prefix bits.

### packet.zig

Long / short header parsing and packet numbers (RFC 9000 section 17).

- `parseLongHeader(data)`: validates the Header Form bit, the Fixed Bit (MUST be 1, else discard), reads the 4-byte version, DCID and SCID (each length capped at 20), and returns `packet_type` (0 = Initial, 2 = Handshake) plus the leftover `rest`.
- `decodePacketNumber(largest_pn, truncated_pn, pn_nbits)`: RFC 9000 Appendix A.3 packet number reconstruction. Computes `expected = largest_pn + 1`, a half-window around it, and the candidate `(expected & ~mask) | truncated_pn`, then adjusts by one window if the candidate falls outside the half-window. The window comparison is done in signed `i128`, not `u64`, so a small packet number does not underflow. This is the correctness fix that let connections survive past the first packet-number wrap.
- `packetNumberLength`, `ShortHeader`, and `parseShortHeader` are the full-RFC reference (implemented and tested). The live path uses a simpler inline packet-number-length rule on send and parses the short header inline in `protection.zig`.

### frame.zig

QUIC transport frame parsing (RFC 9000 sections 12 / 19).

- `parseFrame(data)` reads one frame: `0x00` PADDING (coalesces a run of zeros), `0x01` PING, `0x06` CRYPTO (offset + length + data), `0x07` NEW_TOKEN (validated, non-empty), `0x08..0x0f` STREAM (the OFF / LEN / FIN bit-flag scheme). An unknown frame type is a `FrameEncodingError`.
- `Space` (initial / handshake / zero_rtt / one_rtt) and `framePermittedIn` model the RFC 9000 Table 3 per-space permission matrix. Implemented and tested, not enforced on the serve path yet.

This file is QUIC-transport frames only. ACK lives in `flow.zig`, close frames in `close.zig`, HTTP/3 frames in `h3.zig` / `response.zig`.

### flow.zig

Flow control, ACK, and path validation (RFC 9000 4 / 19.3 / 19.17).

- `FlowLimit { limit, used }`: `consume(end)` raises `FlowControlError` past the limit, `advertise(new_limit)` only ever increases.
- `parseAck(data, ack_delay_exponent)`: parses ACK type 0x02 / 0x03 (0x03 carries ECN counts), resolving the relative range encoding (smallest = largest - range, next largest = previous smallest - gap - 2) into absolute inclusive `Range`s, and decodes the delay with the ack-delay exponent.
- `parsePathData` / `pathValidates`: PATH_CHALLENGE / PATH_RESPONSE echo (implemented, not yet driven by the migration path).

Incoming MAX_DATA (0x10) / MAX_STREAM_DATA (0x11) frames (the client's grants for the server's replies) are applied in `dispatch/common.zig` (`applyStreamCredit`). The outgoing grants (the server rolling its own one-time handshake budgets forward) live in `connection.zig`: `replenishBidiStreams` for the MAX_STREAMS stream-count credit and `replenishMaxData` for the MAX_DATA byte credit, fed by `request.zig` (`streamBytes`) and encoded by `response.zig` (`buildMaxStreams` / `buildMaxData`).

### stream.zig (deferred)

Stream id namespace and send / receive state machines (RFC 9000 2 / 3 / 5.1.1), plus a connection-id pool with `active_connection_id_limit`.

- `streamType(id)` by `id & 0x03`: client_bidi (0), server_bidi (1), client_uni (2), server_uni (3).
- `sendTransition` / `recvTransition`: the Figure 2 / Figure 3 state machines as pure transition functions (a `null` result is an illegal event).
- `ConnIdPool` and `parseNewConnectionId`: CID pooling for migration.

Implemented and unit-tested, not wired into the serve path (the v1 engine does not migrate or pool CIDs). NEW_CONNECTION_ID is currently skipped when parsing requests.

### close.zig

Connection close, stateless reset, and anti-amplification (RFC 9000 19.19 / 10.2 / 10.3 / 8.1).

- `parseConnectionClose`: type `0x1c` (QUIC, carries a Frame Type field) or `0x1d` (application, no Frame Type).
- `CloseState` (open / closing / draining / closed) and `closeTransition(state, event)`: the RFC 9000 10.2 termination state machine. `maySendInState` is false for draining.
- `AntiAmplification { received, sent, validated }`: `maySend(bytes)` is `validated or sent + bytes <= 3 * received`, the 3x cap before address validation (RFC 9000 8.1). `initialDatagramValid(size)` enforces the 1200-byte client Initial floor.
- `isStatelessReset` / `resetSizeAllowed`: stateless-reset detection and its own amplification guard.

---

## Layer T: TLS over QUIC

### keyschedule.zig

The QUIC handshake key schedule (RFC 8446 7.1 secret tree + RFC 9001 5.1 quic labels). Reuses `src/tls/key_schedule.zig` (`Transcript`, `HkdfSha256`, `deriveSecret`) for the TLS 1.3 machinery, then layers the QUIC per-level key derivation on top via `crypto.AesKeys.fromSecret`.

- `handshakeKeys(shared, transcript_hash)`: `early = Extract(0, 0)`, `derived = deriveSecret(early, "derived", "")`, `handshake_secret = Extract(derived, shared)`, then `"s hs traffic"` / `"c hs traffic"` traffic secrets, returning `HandshakeKeys { server, client, handshake_secret, server_traffic, client_traffic }`.
- `applicationKeys(handshake_secret, transcript_through_finished)`: the 1-RTT master secret and `"s ap traffic"` / `"c ap traffic"` application secrets, returning `AppKeys { server, client }`.

### tls.zig (glue, partly deferred)

The join between the TLS 1.3 handshake and QUIC (RFC 9001 section 4): the handshake messages ride CRYPTO frames, not TLS records.

- `CryptoStream { buf: [4096]u8, present: [4096]bool }`: reassembles CRYPTO frames by offset (`insert`, `readableLen`, `readable`), idempotent on overlap / duplicate. This is live (the Initial-level stream lives on the `Connection`).
- `quicKey`, `clientInitialSecret`, `tlsVersionAcceptable`, `InitialKeys` (the 4.9.1 Initial-key discard tracker), and `ZeroRttPolicy` (0-RTT rejected by default) are implemented and tested but not yet gating the serve path.

### serverhello.zig

ServerHello generation, the start of the server send path.

- `buildServerHelloInitial(...)`: from the parsed ClientHello, run the server side of X25519 ECDHE, `handshake.negotiate` + `handshake.serializeServerHello` (reusing `src/tls`), wrap the ServerHello in a CRYPTO frame at offset 0, and `protection.sealInitial` it. Updates the transcript with ClientHello + ServerHello and derives Handshake keys via `keyschedule.handshakeKeys`. Returns the packet bytes plus the ECDHE shared secret. Handles the common X25519 path (curl's default).

### flight.zig

The server's Handshake-level TLS flight.

- `encodeTransportParams(...)`: the QUIC transport parameters (RFC 9000 18.2): `original_destination_connection_id` (0x00) and `initial_source_connection_id` (0x0f) carry the client's first DCID and the server SCID byte-exact (curl validates them), plus `max_idle_timeout` (0x01), `initial_max_data` (0x04), the three `initial_max_stream_data_*` (0x05 / 0x06 / 0x07), and `initial_max_streams_bidi` / `_uni` (0x08 / 0x09).
- `buildEncryptedExtensions(...)`: EncryptedExtensions with the ALPN `h3` extension and the `quic_transport_parameters` extension (0x0039), hand-built here because QUIC needs both, which the TLS record layer omits.
- `buildHandshakeFlight(...)`: EncryptedExtensions + `certificate.buildCertificate` + `buildCertificateVerify` + `buildFinished` (from `src/tls/certificate.zig`), each fed into the transcript, wrapped in one CRYPTO frame and sealed with the Handshake keys (`protection.sealHandshake`).

### transport_params.zig

Client transport parameter parsing (RFC 9000 18). The server must respect the limits the client advertises before sending.

- `parse(ext_body)` walks the varint-framed (id, length, value) entries and pulls out the four the response path needs: `initial_max_data` (0x04), `initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local` (0x05, the limit for the server's reply on the client-initiated bidi request stream), `ack_delay_exponent` (0x0a, default 3, clamped to 0..20), and `max_udp_payload_size` (0x03, floored at 1200). Every other parameter is skipped.
- `fromClientHello(client_hello)` finds the 0x0039 extension by manually walking the ClientHello structure.

---

## protection.zig: packet protection (open + seal)

Removes / applies header protection and AEAD, the inverse pair around the packet number (RFC 9001 5.3 / 5.4). AES-128-GCM throughout.

Open (receive):
- `openInitial` (packet_type 0), `openHandshake` (packet_type 2), `openShort` (1-RTT). Each samples 16 ciphertext bytes at `pn_offset + 4`, computes the mask with `crypto.headerMaskAes`, unmasks the first byte (low 4 bits for a long header, low 5 for a short header) and the packet-number bytes, builds the nonce, and AEAD-decrypts with the unprotected header as associated data. `openShort` reconstructs the packet number with `packet.decodePacketNumber` when a `largest_pn` is tracked, else uses the truncated wire value (the first packet has no prior largest).

Seal (send):
- `sealInitial`, `sealHandshake`, `sealShort`: build the header, sample and mask, AEAD-encrypt. `short_seal_overhead_max` bounds the 1-RTT overhead (`1 + 20 + 4 + tag_length`).

---

## Layer P: QPACK header compression

### qpack.zig (live, static-only)

QPACK static-table field lines (RFC 9204). A static-only field section uses a Required-Insert-Count-0 / Base-0 prefix (two zero bytes).

- `decodePrefixedInt` / `encodePrefixedInt`: the RFC 7541 5.1 prefixed integer every representation rides on.
- `static_table`: the leading 44 entries (indices 0..43) of RFC 9204 Appendix A, covering the pseudo-headers plus common fields (`:method` GET/POST/etc. at 17..21, `:status` 200/304/404/503 at 25..28, `:path` at 1, `:authority` at 0), and the content-negotiation entries used by the serve path: `accept-encoding` (index 31, request input) and `content-encoding` br / gzip (indices 42 / 43, response output).
- `decodeIndexedFieldLine` (RFC 9204 4.5.2) and `decodeLiteralNameRef` (4.5.4) for decode, `encodeStaticIndexedFieldLine` for encode.
- `StreamRegistry`: the at-most-one encoder / decoder stream check (implemented, not enforced yet).

### qpack_dynamic.zig (deferred)

The dynamic table and decoder-stream instructions (RFC 9204 3.2 / 4.4). `DynamicTable` (append-with-eviction, 32-byte per-entry overhead, `setCapacity`), the Required-Insert-Count / Base transform, and the Section Acknowledgment / Stream Cancellation / Insert Count Increment decoder instructions, plus the QPACK error codes. Fully implemented and unit-tested, not wired: there is no non-zero dynamic-capacity config, so the live path is static-only.

### huffman.zig (live)

The RFC 7541 Appendix B Huffman decoder QPACK shares with HPACK, used for string literals (a request `:path` arrives Huffman-encoded).

- `decode(out, input)`: walks the bitstream MSB-first, emitting a symbol the moment the accumulated bits match a code of that exact length. The 256-symbol code table is bucketed and sorted by bit length in a comptime block (`HuffmanIndex`), so decode only scans the bucket for the current bit length. Trailing all-ones bits are EOS padding, ignored. Returns `null` on output overflow or an unresolvable code past 30 bits. The live decode is invoked from `dispatch/common.zig` (`decodePath`) into the connection's `path_scratch` when the request carries the Huffman flag.

---

## Layer H: HTTP/3 semantics

### request.zig (live)

Decodes a request out of a decrypted 1-RTT payload.

- `parseRequests(payload, out)`: scans for client-initiated bidi STREAM frames (`stream.id & 0x03 == 0`), decoding each in arrival order up to `max_requests_per_packet` (96). `parseRequest` returns the first.
- `decodeRequestStream` walks the HTTP/3 frames inside the stream data for the first HEADERS frame (type 0x01), and `decodeHeaders` QPACK-decodes the field section, reading the RIC / Base prefix and then indexed or literal-name-ref field lines. It captures `:method` and `:path` (the pseudo-headers, first) and `accept-encoding` (a regular field, so the scan continues past the pseudo-headers to reach it), stopping once all three are in hand.
- `DecodedRequest { method, path, path_huffman, accept_encoding, accept_encoding_huffman }` carries the Huffman flags through, expanded later by `decodePath` / `decodeAcceptEncoding`.

### response.zig (live)

Serializes a full 1-RTT QUIC payload.

- `buildResponse(...)` assembles, in order: an optional ACK frame (`buildAck` / `buildAckRanges`), an optional HANDSHAKE_DONE (0x1e), an optional server control stream (stream id 3) carrying the stream-type byte 0x00 plus an empty SETTINGS frame `{0x04, 0x00}`, an optional MAX_STREAMS (`buildMaxStreams`, type 0x12), an optional MAX_DATA (`buildMaxData`, type 0x10), then the request-stream content, and optionally an application CONNECTION_CLOSE (0x1d, H3_NO_ERROR = 0x0100).
- `buildRequestStreamContent`: an HTTP/3 HEADERS frame (type 0x01) with a static-only QPACK prefix (RIC 0 / Base 0) plus the indexed `:status` line (`statusIndexedFieldLine` maps 103/200/304/404/503 to static indices 24..28, default 200) and, when the handler set one, an indexed `content-encoding` line (`contentEncodingFieldLine` emits static index 42 for br / 43 for gzip, nothing for identity), followed by a DATA frame (type 0x00) with the body, wrapped in a STREAM frame with FIN. `buildStreamPrefix` (the large-body path) takes the same `content_encoding`, so a resumed multi-packet body keeps its header. The engine emits the field but never compresses: the handler owns the coded body.

### h3.zig (deferred)

The full HTTP/3 framing and semantics (RFC 9114): the `FrameType` enum (data 0x00, headers 0x01, cancel_push 0x03, settings 0x04, push_promise 0x05, goaway 0x07, max_push_id 0x0d), the control-stream `settings-first` state machine (`ControlStream`), the request frame-order state machine (`requestFrameTransition`), full message validation (`validateMessage`: lowercase names, pseudo-header ordering, mandatory / prohibited pseudo-headers, Content-Length vs DATA sum), GOAWAY / MAX_PUSH_ID monotonicity trackers, and the 17 HTTP/3 error codes plus the grease range. Implemented and unit-tested, not wired: the live request path handles the minimal framing inline in `dispatch/common.zig`.

---

## connection.zig: per-connection state

`Connection` ties the layers together: the Initial keys, the CRYPTO reassembly stream, the RTT estimator and congestion controller, the anti-amplification budget and close state, and the HTTP/3 control stream. It is fixed-size (no per-packet heap), stored inside the CID table slot.

Handshake phase is tracked by flags set on the send path (in `dispatch/common.zig`) rather than a single enum: `server_hello_sent`, `handshake_ready` (Handshake keys derived), `app_ready` (1-RTT keys derived), then `close_state`.

Key fields and methods:
- `dcid`, `our_scid`, `peer_scid`, `peer_addr` (overwritten per received datagram, so a 4-tuple change transparently retargets sends), `initial_client` / `initial_server`, `hs_keys`, `app_keys`, `handshake_transcript`.
- `AckTracker { largest_pn, received_mask: u64 }`: a 64-bit sliding bitmask of received packet numbers (bit 0 = largest), so the server emits honest ACK ranges.
- `SendStream` (up to 64 per connection): a response body streamed across packets (`stream_id`, `body`, `content_encoding`, `sent`, `high_water`, `unacked`, `stream_limit`). The prefix is rebuilt per packet, so `content_encoding` is stored to keep the `content-encoding` header consistent across a resumed body.
- `SentRange` ring (128 entries): the loss-detection log. `recordSentRange` overwrites the oldest slot, decrementing `bytes_in_flight` and the owning stream's `unacked` first if it was still in flight (prevents a leak / truncation).
- `replenishBidiStreams(highest_bidi_id, window)`: the rolling MAX_STREAMS credit. Tracks the client's highest request stream, and once it has used more than half the current window, raises the cumulative grant to `high_water + window` and returns the new value (else `null`), so the connection never stalls once the initial allowance is spent.
- `replenishMaxData(bytes_received, window)`: the rolling MAX_DATA credit, the byte twin of the stream-count credit above. Accumulates the STREAM-frame payload bytes each packet carried (`request.streamBytes`, all streams, since connection-level flow control counts them all) and, once consumption crosses half the current window, raises the cumulative grant to `consumed + window` and returns the new value (else `null`). Without it the connection deadlocks once the client has sent `initial_max_data` bytes of requests, whatever stream credit remains. Retransmitted bytes may be counted twice, which only grants credit early (a grant is a limit, so overshooting is harmless while undershooting stalls the peer).
- `onAckFrame(ack, now_us)`: samples RTT from the packet matching `ack.largest`, retires acked ranges, credits `cc.onAckedBytes`, resets the PTO backoff, and declares loss for still-outstanding earlier ranges (`recovery.packetLost`), rewinding those streams and calling `cc.onCongestionEvent()` once per ACK if any loss occurred.
- `onMaintenance(now_us, max_idle_us)`: the time-driven sweep. On Probe Timeout it declares outstanding ranges lost and rewinds the streams for retransmission, but does NOT cut the congestion window (a PTO is not a congestion signal, RFC 9002 6.2). Loss never evicts a connection. It reports `idle = true` only on idle-timeout silence or a `draining` / `closed` close state (a received CONNECTION_CLOSE evicts promptly).

---

## Layer L: recovery.zig

Sender-side loss detection and congestion control (RFC 9002). Integer microseconds and integer bytes throughout, so every value is exact.

- `RttEstimator.onSample`: the RFC 9002 5.1..5.3 EWMA (`smoothed = (7*smoothed + adjusted)/8`, `rttvar = (3*rttvar + |smoothed - adjusted|)/4`), with the ack-delay adjustment.
- `packetLost`: lost when `largest_acked - packet_number >= 3` (the reordering threshold) or the time-since-sent passes `lossTimeThreshold` (`9/8 * max(smoothed, latest)`, floored at the 1ms granularity).
- `computePto` (`smoothed + max(4*rttvar, granularity) + max_ack_delay`) and `ptoWithBackoff` (`base << backoff`, capped at a 64x backoff).
- `CongestionController` (NewReno): `congestion_window` starts at `max(config initial window, 2 * max_datagram_size)`, `onAckedBytes` grows it (slow start adds the acked bytes, congestion avoidance adds `mds * acked / cwnd`), `onCongestionEvent` halves it into `ssthresh`, `onPersistentCongestion` collapses it to the minimum. The window bounds `pumpStream` against `bytes_in_flight`.

---

## demux.zig: the connection-id table

A QUIC connection is keyed by its Destination Connection ID, not by a socket.

- `ConnId { bytes: [20]u8, len: u8 }` with `fromSlice` (truncates to 20) and `eql`.
- `Table(T, capacity)`: a fixed-capacity store (no allocation, returns null on overflow) with an embedded open-addressing hash index (load factor 0.5, Wyhash-keyed, tombstone deletion) for O(1) find, so a per-packet demux does not cost a linear scan. `put` inserts, `find` looks up, `addAlias` adds a second key resolving to an existing slot (used to alias the server SCID onto the connection after ServerHello), `remove` tombstones every bucket pointing at the slot.
- Production instance: `demux.Table(Connection, 256)`, one per worker, heap-allocated. A new connection is created when a long-header Initial packet (packet_type 0) arrives for an unknown DCID.

The v1 engine's `.ASYNC` model runs one worker that owns the whole table, so a connection migration (a 4-tuple change) is just a new peer address on an existing CID, with no cross-core routing.

---

## server.zig and dispatch/

`Server.init(handler, config)` (server.zig) is a thin facade: `init` stores the config, `run` validates (`error.PortNotConfigured` on a zero port, `error.TlsRequired` on a null TLS context) then switches on `config.dispatch_model` into the per-model `dispatch/` entry point. All models are Linux-only.

- `dispatch/common.zig`: the shared machinery. `workerLoop` (recvmmsg in, `serveDatagram` per datagram, sendmmsg out), `runSingle` (one worker on the calling thread, ASYNC), `runMulti` (one SO_REUSEPORT thread per CPU, pinned, POOL / MIXED). `processDatagram` demuxes by DCID and decrypts (`openInitial` / `openHandshake` / `openShort`). `serveDatagram` drives the matching step: `sendServerHello` on a complete ClientHello, or `sendResponse` on a 1-RTT request. `sendResponse` applies ACKs (feeding `onAckFrame`), parses requests, replenishes bidi stream credit and the connection-wide byte credit (charging the packet's stream bytes via `streamBytes` into `replenishMaxData`), coalesces the ACK + HANDSHAKE_DONE + SETTINGS + MAX_STREAMS + MAX_DATA + small responses into one sealed packet (a `COALESCE_PAYLOAD_MAX` budget), registers oversized bodies as `SendStream`s, and `pumpStream`s each active stream within the congestion window (a due grant not yet sealed rides the first pumped packet, like the ACK). `sweepMaintenance` runs `onMaintenance` per connection at a bounded interval, retransmitting PTO-expired flights and evicting idle / closed connections.
- `dispatch/async.zig`, `pool.zig`, `mixed.zig`: thin wrappers into `runSingle` / `runMulti`.
- `dispatch/epoll.zig`: `workerLoopEpoll`, an epoll readiness loop draining to EAGAIN on the same per-core shape, calling the shared `serveDatagram` / `sweepMaintenance`. It arms an epoll timeout so the maintenance sweep runs during an I/O lull.
- `dispatch/uring.zig`: `workerLoopUring`, a real io_uring completion loop (multishot recv on a provided buffer ring when available, else a pool of one-shot recv SQEs), with a double-buffered send path so sends never block the loop. Folds to `epoll.workerLoopEpoll` per-worker when io_uring init fails.

Binding is `datagram.open(ip, port, reuse)` from `src/udp/datagram.zig`, `reuse = true` (SO_REUSEPORT) for the per-core models so several workers share the port.
