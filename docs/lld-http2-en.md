# LLD: zix.Http2 (h2c HTTP/2)

Internal implementation details. For design rationale see [`docs/hld-http2-en.md`](hld-http2-en.md), ADR-043 (the per-engine `dispatch/` split), and ADR-052 (multiplexed TLS).

The blocking models (`.ASYNC`, `.POOL`, `.MIXED`) share one connection path (`core.serveConn` -> `serveH2cLoop`). The `.EPOLL` and `.URING` models drive a separate, resumable, non-blocking state machine (`mux.zig`) that owns the bulk of this document. Both feed one comptime `Router`. The TLS path (`config.tls != null`) terminates in place, either multiplexed (`tls_mux.zig`, for `.EPOLL` / `.URING`) or thread-per-connection (`tls_serve.zig`, which also serves TLS 1.2).

---

## mux.zig

The resumable h2c state machine for `.EPOLL` / `.URING`. One `MuxConn` per fd. The read accumulator `rbuf` persists across readable events and holds a partial frame until the rest arrives, so a single worker drives many connections. Connection frames and responses write straight to the fd via the `frame.*` helpers (which poll on EAGAIN for a non-blocking socket), and a handler runs inline on the worker, so like the gRPC mux it must stay bounded.

### MuxStream

One stream within a connection, borrowed from the per-worker pool while open.

```zig
const MuxStream = struct {
    id: u31 = 0,
    state: StreamState = .IDLE,                          // IDLE | OPEN | HALF_CLOSED_REMOTE | CLOSED
    headers: [frame.MAX_HEADERS]hpack.Header = undefined,// inline, MAX_HEADERS = 64
    header_count: usize = 0,
    header_scratch: []u8 = &.{},                         // pooled buffer, sized to opts.max_header_scratch
    body: []u8 = &.{},                                   // pooled buffer, sized to opts.max_body
    body_len: usize = 0,
    end_headers: bool = false,
    end_stream: bool = false,

    send_window: i64 = 65535,          // peer's remaining receive window for this stream (RFC 7540 6.9)
    pending_body: []const u8 = &.{},   // unsent tail of a body capped by a window, resumed by WINDOW_UPDATE
    pending_end: bool = false,

    next_free: ?*MuxStream = null,     // freelist link, valid only while idle in the pool
};
```

`headers` is an inline array. `body` and `header_scratch` are the pooled stream's own buffers, sized by the serve options and reused across borrows. `pending_body` points into caller-owned memory that must outlive the stream (the static cache), so the slot stays borrowed until it drains.

### MuxConn

Heap-owned per-connection h2 state, one per fd, private to the owning worker.

```zig
pub const MuxConn = struct {
    fd: std.posix.fd_t,
    opts: core.ServeOpts,

    rbuf: []u8,                 // read accumulator, persists across events, holds partial frames
    rstart: usize,
    rend: usize,

    hpack_dec: hpack.HpackDecoder,
    streams: []*MuxStream,      // pointer array: an idle conn reserves max_streams pointers, not buffers
    slots: []bool,

    last_stream_id: u31,
    phase: MuxPhase,            // await_preface | await_upgrade | await_preface2 | h2

    send_window: i64 = 65535,      // connection-level send window (all our DATA)
    peer_init_window: i64 = 65535, // peer's SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE, the starting per-stream window

    pub fn init(fd, opts) ?*MuxConn   // one alloc each for conn, rbuf, streams, slots; null on OOM
    pub fn deinit(self) void          // returns any still-open stream to the pool first
};
```

`rbuf` is sized `max(opts.conn_read_buf_min, opts.max_frame_size + frame.FRAME_PAYLOAD_SLACK + 9)`. Because `streams` holds pointers, the heavy per-stream state (inline header table plus body / scratch buffers) is not reserved at connection open, it is borrowed from the pool on stream open.

### Per-worker stream-slot pool

The key allocation strategy. A worker drives many connections from one thread, and each connection borrows a `MuxStream` only while a stream is open, returning it on close. The freelist is a threadlocal (shared-nothing per worker, no atomics), so resident stream memory tracks concurrent streams on the worker, not connections times `max_streams`. Buffers are allocated once per pooled stream and reused across borrows, so the steady state does zero per-stream allocation.

```zig
threadlocal var stream_pool: ?*MuxStream = null;

fn acquireStream(opts) ?*MuxStream  // pop the freelist (reset clean) or grow with a fresh stream + buffers
fn releaseStream(st) void           // reset scalars (st.* = .{}), keep body / header_scratch, LIFO push
fn releaseSlot(conn, slot) void     // mark the slot free and return its borrowed stream to the pool
```

`acquireStream` pops the freelist when non-empty (the slot was already cleared on release) and returns it if its buffers meet `opts.max_body` / `opts.max_header_scratch`, otherwise it grows the pool with a fresh `MuxStream` plus a `max_body` body and a `max_header_scratch` scratch. `releaseStream` saves the two buffers, resets every scalar to defaults, restores the buffers, and pushes LIFO so a hot stream is reused first.

### slotFor / findSlot

`slotFor(conn, stream_id)` claims the first free slot, borrows a stream via `acquireStream`, stamps its id, and returns the index (null at `max_streams` or on a pool allocation failure, the caller then sends `RST_STREAM REFUSED_STREAM`). `findSlot(stream_id, streams, used)` locates an open stream by id. Both are linear scans over `max_streams`.

### muxProcess / muxFrameLoop

`muxProcess` is the handshake phase machine, then the frame loop:

- `await_preface`: need 3 bytes. If they are not `"PRI"`, set `await_upgrade` and call `muxHandleUpgrade`. Else need the 24-byte `PREFACE`, validate it, send server SETTINGS, set `h2`.
- `await_upgrade`: `muxHandleUpgrade` (accumulate to `\r\n\r\n`, reply `400` without `Upgrade: h2c`, `101` with it, then `await_preface2`, and the stream-1 request is not served).
- `await_preface2`: after the `101`, validate the preface, send SETTINGS, set `h2`.
- `h2`: `muxFrameLoop`.

`muxFrameLoop` runs over the buffered bytes while a whole frame is present:

```
loop:
    if buffered < 9 -> return .keep_alive
    fh = parseFrameHeader(rbuf[rstart..][0..9])
    if fh.length > max_payload -> GOAWAY FRAME_SIZE_ERROR, return .close
    if buffered < 9 + fh.length -> return .keep_alive
    advance past header + payload
    switch fh.frame_type:
        SETTINGS      -> skip ACK; apply HEADER_TABLE_SIZE (resize + evictTo) and
                         INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE (shift every open stream's send_window by the
                         delta, RFC 7540 6.9.2); send ACK + one connection WINDOW_UPDATE
        WINDOW_UPDATE -> stream 0: send_window += inc, resumeAll; else findSlot,
                         stream.send_window += inc, resumeStream
        HEADERS       -> id guards; slotFor; reset stream; send_window = peer_init_window;
                         strip padding / priority; hpack decode into header_scratch;
                         on END_HEADERS + END_STREAM -> muxDispatch
        CONTINUATION  -> findSlot; append-decode; dispatch on END
        DATA          -> findSlot; strip padding; WINDOW_UPDATE(0) + WINDOW_UPDATE(sid) for
                         the data length; copy into body (capped, truncates past max_body);
                         dispatch on END_STREAM
        RST_STREAM    -> findSlot -> releaseSlot
        PING          -> skip ACK; sendPingAck
        GOAWAY        -> return .close
        PRIORITY      -> ignore
```

A decode failure sends `RST_STREAM COMPRESSION_ERROR` and frees the slot. `sendServerSettings` advertises `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`, `INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` 65535, `MAX_FRAME_SIZE`, and `ENABLE_PUSH` 0.

### muxDispatch

Extracts method / path from the decoded pseudo-headers (length-gated compares: `:path` is 5, `:method` is 7), sets `active_conn = conn`, records `tl_req_path` / `tl_req_body` only when a response cache is installed, and calls `core.Router(routes).dispatch`. After the handler returns, the slot is freed unless the response body is parked on a window (`pending_body.len > 0`), in which case a later `WINDOW_UPDATE` resumes and frees it.

### pumpBody / resumeStream / resumeAll / sendResponseStream

The send-side flow control (`active_conn` is the threadlocal that binds a running handler's send back to its connection windows).

- `pumpBody(conn, stream, body, end)`: writes DATA up to `min(conn.send_window, stream.send_window)` and `max_frame_size`, decrements both windows per chunk, sets END_STREAM only on the final chunk once the whole body has gone out, and parks the remainder in `pending_body` / `pending_end`.
- `resumeStream(conn, slot)`: after a stream window grew, `pumpBody`s the parked tail and frees the slot when it fully drains.
- `resumeAll(conn)`: after the connection window grew, resumes every parked stream.
- `sendResponseStream(fd, sid, status, content_type, content_encoding, body)`: the flow-controlled response entry. With no `active_conn` or no matching slot it falls back to `frame.sendResponseEncoded` (immediate, unmetered). Otherwise it writes HEADERS (`sendRespHeaders` -> `hpack.respHeaderBlock`) then `pumpBody(..., true)`. The body is referenced, not copied, so it must outlive the stream (a process-lifetime cache).

### onReadable / processRing

`onReadable` (`.EPOLL`) loops: compact `rbuf`, `read` into `rbuf[rend..]` (WouldBlock -> `keep_alive`, 0 or error -> `close`), then `muxProcess`, repeating until EAGAIN. Level-triggered epoll re-fires if more arrives. `processRing` (`.URING`) is the same processing pass with no read loop and no trailing flush: the ring owns the recv and re-arms it after this returns.

---

## hpack.zig

Static table, Huffman codec, decoder (with dynamic-table eviction), stateless encoder, and the response-prefix cache.

### respHeaderBlock + response-header cache

`respHeaderBlock(dst, status, content_type, content_encoding, content_length)` encodes a full response header block. The `[:status, content-type, content-encoding]` prefix is served from a process-global append-only cache, only `content_length` (which varies) is encoded per call. A null `content_length` omits the field (a bodyless END_STREAM response).

The cache is `g_resp_prefix: [32]RespPrefix` with a release-published count and a spinlock (`g_resp_prefix_lock`). Readers scan `0..count` lock-free, the spinlock serializes only the rare insert (one per distinct triple). It is byte-identical on every connection because `HpackEncoder` is stateless: static table plus literal-without-indexing, never the dynamic table or a size update, so the cached bytes plus a per-call content-length are valid HPACK. A too-long triple or a full cache falls back to a direct encode, so correctness never depends on a hit. A test asserts `respHeaderBlock` matches four `writeHeader` calls byte-for-byte.

### HpackDecoder

```zig
pub const HpackDecoder = struct {
    dyn: [128]HpackEntry = undefined,
    dyn_count, dyn_size, max_size = 4096,
    dyn_buf: [8192]u8 = undefined,   // dyn[] entries always slice into here, never per-call scratch
    dyn_buf_pos,
};
```

`decode(block, out, scratch)` handles indexed, literal-with-incremental-indexing, dynamic-table-size-update, and literal-without-indexing representations. Every decoded slice points into the caller's `scratch`. Dynamic entries are copied into `dyn_buf` (connection-lifetime), so an indexed lookup stays valid after a stream slot's scratch is reused (a fixed regression). `evictTo(target)` drops the oldest entries until the table fits, `compactDynBuf` repacks live entries at the front of `dyn_buf` when it fills, and `addDynamic` sizes an entry as `name.len + value.len + 32`. Huffman literals go through `huffDecode`.

### HpackEncoder

`init(buf)` over a caller buffer, `writeHeader(name, value)`: a static-table exact match encodes as indexed, a static name-only match as a name-indexed literal (never added to the dynamic table), otherwise a full literal. `writeString` picks Huffman when it is shorter and types the Huffman result as `?usize` so comptime evaluation (cached blocks) keeps the optional even when the error branch is statically unreachable. Stateless: no dynamic table, no size update.

---

## frame.zig

Frame codec, control-frame senders, and the constants (`FRAME_TYPE_*`, `FLAG_*`, `ERR_*`, `SETTINGS_*`, `PREFACE`, `FRAME_HEADER_LEN` 9, `FRAME_PAYLOAD_SLACK` 256, `DEFAULT_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` 16384, `MAX_HEADERS` 64).

`FrameHeader` is `{ length: u24, frame_type: u8, flags: u8, stream_id: u31 }`. `parseFrameHeader` / `encodeFrameHeader` do no I/O (for buffered or staged writes), `writeFrameHeader` and `readFrameHeader` add the fd I/O.

`fdWriteAll` checks a threadlocal `write_hook`: when set (the TLS seal path, or the coalescing sink) it hands the plaintext to the hook, otherwise it calls `fdWriteAllRaw`, the blocking write-all that polls on `POLL.OUT` for a non-blocking socket's EAGAIN and retries on INTR. `fdWriteAllRaw` is also the hook's own flush path, so a coalescing flush does not re-enter the hook.

`sendSettings` / `sendSettingsAck` / `sendPingAck` / `sendGoaway` / `sendRstStream` / `sendWindowUpdate` encode one control frame each. `sendResponse` -> `sendResponseEncoded` is the immediate, unmetered response (no flow control): HEADERS via `respHeaderBlock`, then the body framed in `<= DEFAULT_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` DATA chunks with END_STREAM on the last (or on HEADERS when the body is empty). Large bodies that may exceed the peer window use `mux.sendResponseStream` instead.

---

## core.zig

Shared request processing, the router, and the blocking connection path.

### ServeOpts / Router / Route

`ServeOpts` holds the per-connection tuning with these defaults:

| field | default |
| :- | :- |
| `max_streams` | 128 |
| `max_frame_size` | 16384 (`DEFAULT_MAX_FRAME_SIZE`) |
| `max_header_scratch` | 4096 |
| `max_body` | 16384 |
| `conn_read_buf_min` | 32 * 1024 |
| `tls_write_buf_initial` | 16 * 1024 |
| `response_cache` | false |

`HandlerFn` is `fn(method, headers, body, fd, sid) void`. `Route` is `{ path, handler, kind = .EXACT }` with `RouteKind` `EXACT | PREFIX`. `Router(comptime routes)` builds a comptime table: `EXACT` routes resolve through a `StaticStringMap` (O(1)), `PREFIX` routes match the longest registered prefix on a path-segment boundary, the query string is stripped first, and an unmatched path sends `404`.

The per-worker response cache (ADR-036) also lives here: `tl_cache`, `serveCached` / `sendCached`, and `requestKey` (Wyhash over path + body). It is installed by the `.EPOLL` / `.URING` workers and keyed off `tl_req_path` / `tl_req_body`, which `muxDispatch` records.

### Blocking path (serveConn / serveH2cLoop)

`serveConn` sets `TCP_NODELAY` and calls `serveConnInner`, which reads 3 bytes: `"PRI"` runs the h2c-direct preface (validate, `sendSettings`, `serveH2cLoop`), anything else runs `serveH2cUpgrade` (the HTTP/1.1 `Upgrade: h2c` handshake, which serves the initial stream-1 request then `serveH2cLoop`). `serveH2cLoop` allocates a payload buffer plus a `[]Stream` slot table and runs the same frame switch as the mux with blocking `readFrameHeader` + `recvExact`, dispatching inline via `dispatchStream`. Note the blocking `Stream` is a fixed inline struct (`body: [65536]u8`, `header_scratch: [4096]u8`) held `max_streams` deep per connection, in contrast to the mux's pooled buffers sized to the serve options.

---

## dispatch/ and tls_mux.zig

`server.zig` holds the public `Http2Server` type and a thin `run()` switch: `.ASYNC` / `.POOL` / `.MIXED` keep the accept-thread structure (`common.Dispatch(routes)`, `ConnQueue`) and call `core.serveConn`, `.EPOLL` calls `epoll.runEpoll`, `.URING` calls `uring.runUring`, and `config.tls != null` routes `.EPOLL` / `.URING` to `tls_mux.runTlsMux`, everything else to `tls_serve.runTls`.

### dispatch/epoll.zig

`ConnTable` is a private per-worker fd -> `*MuxConn` map, indexed by fd over `slab.mapZeroedSlots(MAX_FD = 1 << 16)` (kernel-zeroed, demand-paged), not shared between workers. `acceptAll` drains `accept4(NONBLOCK | CLOEXEC)` to EAGAIN, sets `TCP_NODELAY` and the optional busy-poll, builds a `MuxConn`, and registers `EPOLL.IN | RDHUP`. `epollMuxWorkerFn(routes)` pins to a CPU, opens a private `SO_REUSEPORT` listener plus its own epoll instance and optional response cache, and runs `epoll_wait` (up to 512 events): the listener drives `acceptAll`, a connection fd runs `beginCoalesce` -> `mux.onReadable` -> `endCoalesce` (close on a batch write failure). `runEpoll` spawns `worker_count = pool_size` (0 = available CPU count) threads and joins them.

### dispatch/uring.zig

The io_uring shape of the same loop (ADR-037 Phase 4). `initUringRing` requests `SINGLE_ISSUER | DEFER_TASKRUN | CQSIZE | CLAMP` and falls back to a flagless ring. A worker arms a multishot accept, keeps an fd-indexed `[]?*UringConn` slot table, and tags each `user_data` with a `gen: u24` so a stale recv CQE for a reused fd is dropped (`lookup`). `armRecv` compacts the accumulator then posts one `prep_recv` into `rbuf[rend..]` (one recv in flight per connection), and `handleRecv` advances `rend`, runs `beginCoalesce` -> `mux.processRing` -> `endCoalesce`, then re-arms. Responses go direct-to-fd on the non-blocking socket (no reply cork is ring-sent). `runUring` probes the ring at startup and falls back to `runEpoll` when io_uring is unavailable.

### dispatch/common.zig

`serveOpts(cfg)` maps `Http2ServerConfig` to `core.ServeOpts` (`max_recv_buf` -> `conn_read_buf_min`, `tls_write_buf_initial_bytes` -> `tls_write_buf_initial`, plus the cache fields). It also holds `setNoDelay`, `setBusyPoll`, `pinToCpu` and `getAvailableCpuCount` (both cgroup-mask aware), and `effectiveCacheEntries` (honors `cache_max_total_bytes`).

The write-coalescing sink is the batching primitive for the cleartext mux: `MuxCoalesceSink` (a 64 KiB threadlocal, one per worker) is installed as `frame.write_hook` by `beginCoalesce(fd)` and torn down by `endCoalesce()`. While installed, every frame the mux writes in one readable batch (HEADERS, DATA, SETTINGS, WINDOW_UPDATE) stages into one buffer and leaves as a single write, so a many-stream batch is one segment rather than one tiny segment per frame under `TCP_NODELAY`. It flushes when full and writes an oversized frame straight through, so correctness never depends on the buffer size. `endCoalesce` returns whether a write failed during the batch.

### tls_mux.zig

Multiplexed h2 over TLS 1.3 (ADR-052): one `SO_REUSEPORT` listener plus one epoll instance per worker, each connection terminating TLS in place via a resumable `tls_session.Session` (no socketpair, no thread per connection). A `TlsConn` holds the session, the `?*MuxConn` h2 state (allocated once the handshake establishes and ALPN selects h2), an outbound-ciphertext backpressure buffer (`wbuf` / `woff` / `wlen`, flushed on EPOLLOUT), and a `plain` staging buffer. The pass is: recv ciphertext -> `session.feed` decrypts -> `feedMux` appends plaintext to `h2.rbuf` and runs `mux.processRing` -> the mux's reply frames route through `frame.write_hook = hookWrite` -> sealed into TLS records -> `sendRaw`.

`hookWrite` is a seal-in-place gather. It accumulates plaintext into `plain`, and whenever the staged prefix plus the new write completes a full record it seals that record straight from source with `sealGather` -> `conn.tls.encrypt2(prefix, tail, sealed)` (which threads down to `connection.writeAppData2` and `record.protect2`), gathering the staged prefix with a slice of the source. This avoids copying a large DATA payload into `plain` first, only the sub-record remainder is staged. The `seal_in_place` toggle is a comptime `const` so the gather path can be A/B'd against the accumulate-then-seal fallback (`flushPlain` -> `encrypt`) without changing any other behavior. `sendRaw` preserves record order (the AEAD nonce is the record sequence number): if ciphertext is already staged it appends rather than writing directly, so a later record never overtakes a staged one on the wire.
