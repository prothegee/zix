# HLD: zix.Logger

Structured event logger with thread-safe writes and automatic protocol integration.

---

## Status

Implemented. See ADR-023 for design rationale.

---

## Goals

- Thread-safe from any context including background OS threads (no `std.Io` dependency).
- Structured per-event method signatures rather than printf-style with a category string.
- Protocol-specific log types: `conn()`, `packet()`, `frame()`, `session()` give machine-parseable lines without post-processing.
- File rotation: daily subdirectory + per-file sequence number, no external tooling required.
- Zero allocation and no syscall on the caller's thread: a record is copied into a 64 KB write buffer and a background flush thread performs every write.
- Caller owns the allocator, logger is `init`/`deinit` lifetime.

---

## Source Layout

```
src/logger/
    logger.zig   // Logger struct with nested Config, Level, ConsoleMode, Dir
```

Export from `src/lib.zig`:
```zig
pub const Logger = @import("logger/logger.zig").Logger;
// zix.Logger, zix.Logger.Level, zix.Logger.ConsoleMode, zix.Logger.Dir, zix.Logger.Config
```

## Public API

| Symbol | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `zix.Logger` | struct | `init(allocator, config)` / `deinit()` / `flush()` |
| `zix.Logger.Config` | struct | Configuration fields (nested type on the struct) |
| `zix.Logger.Level` | enum(u8) | `DEBUG=0` `INFO=1` `WARN=2` `ERROR=3` |
| `zix.Logger.ConsoleMode` | enum(u8) | `OFF=0` `DEBUG_ONLY=1` `ALWAYS=2` |
| `zix.Logger.Dir` | enum(u8) | `RECV=0` `SEND=1`: direction for `packet()` and `frame()` |

---

## Config Fields

| Field | Default | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `console` | `.OFF` | Console output mode |
| `console_min_level` | `.INFO` | Minimum level printed to console |
| `console_fd` | `null` | Descriptor console records and the file-suspension report are written to. `null` means stderr. The caller owns it and must keep it open for as long as the logger lives |
| `save_path` | `""` | Root directory for log files. Must already exist. `""` disables file logging |
| `save_file` | `"log"` | Base filename. Files named `<save_file>-NNNNNN.log` |
| `save_min_level` | `.INFO` | Minimum level written to file |
| `max_lines` | 1,000,000 | Lines per file before rotating to next sequence number |

---

## Log Methods

| Method | Auto-called by | Level | Line format |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| `system(level, component, fmt, args)` | all servers (lifecycle) | caller-set | `DATE TIME LEVEL  [component] message` |
| `access(component, method, path, status, bytes, client_ip, ua, origin)` | zix.Http, zix.Http1, zix.Http2, zix.Http3 (per-request), zixer (per-exchange) | derived from status | `DATE TIME LEVEL  [component:access] METHOD PATH STATUS BYTES "CLIENT_IP" "UA" "ORIGIN"` |
| `conn(peer, dur_ms, err)` | TCP server (per-connection close) | INFO / WARN | `DATE TIME LEVEL  [tcp:conn] PEER dur=NNNms ERR` |
| `packet(dir, peer, size, err)` | UDP server (per-datagram) | INFO / WARN | `DATE TIME LEVEL  [udp:pkt] DIRECTION PEER size=N ERR` |
| `frame(dir, sock_path, size, err)` | UDS (manual) | INFO / WARN | `DATE TIME LEVEL  [uds:frame] DIRECTION SOCKPATH size=N ERR` |
| `session(msg_type, sender, target, seq, state)` | FIX server (per-message) | INFO | `DATE TIME LEVEL  [fix:sess] 35=TYPE sender=S target=T seq=N STATE` |
| `rpc(peer, path, grpc_status, recv_bytes, sent_bytes, dur_ms)` | gRPC server (per-stream close) | INFO / WARN | `DATE TIME LEVEL  [grpc:rpc] PEER PATH status=N recv=N sent=N dur=Nms` |

### Level Derivation

- `access()`: 2xx/3xx=INFO, 4xx=WARN, 5xx=ERROR, other=DEBUG.
- `conn()`: `err == null` -> INFO, `err != null` -> WARN.
- `packet()`, `frame()`: same as `conn()`.
- `session()`: always INFO.
- `rpc()`: `grpc_status == 0` -> INFO, `grpc_status != 0` -> WARN.
- `system()`: caller provides level explicitly.

```

## File Rotation

Files are written to `<save_path>/YYYY-MM-DD/<save_file>-NNNNNN.log`:
- A new date directory is created automatically on the first write of a new calendar day.
- When `line_count` reaches `max_lines`, the sequence number increments and a new file opens.
- Maximum sequence number is 999,999. On exhaustion, file logging suspends and a message is written to stderr.
- `save_path` itself must already exist: the logger does not create it. Use a `createLogDir` helper before `Logger.init`.

---

## Thread Safety

All log methods are safe to call simultaneously from any OS thread:
- A spinlock (atomic CAS) serializes the copy into the shared write buffer. It is held for a `memcpy`, never across a syscall.
- `rawWrite` uses the raw POSIX `write` syscall, and the Windows file sink uses ntdll directly: no `std.Io` dependency, safe on background OS threads.
- No `std.debug.print` or any path through `std.Options.debug_io`. Safe during `zig build test-all`.

### Flush Thread

Each enabled destination holds two write buffers. Producers fill one while the flush thread writes the other, so no caller ever waits on a disk.

- The flush thread is spawned on the first record, because `Logger.init` returns by value and the thread needs the address the logger finally lives at.
- It writes with the lock released. A buffer handed over is untouchable until the write finishes, which is what keeps rotation and close from racing it.
- A record is never dropped. When both buffers are full the producer waits for the write in flight, counted by `stallCount()` so a disk that cannot keep up is visible rather than silent.
- An `ERROR` record is written out before the call returns, so a crash cannot swallow the record that explains it.
- `flush()` and `deinit()` write everything buffered on the calling thread before returning.

**Durability trade-off**: a crash can lose up to one buffer of records that were not yet written. `flush()` and the `ERROR` rule are the two ways to force the boundary.

### Timestamps

Every record and every day directory is stamped in UTC+0000. The logger does not read a local timezone, so a fleet spread across regions produces one comparable ordering.

## Protocol Wiring

Each server accepts an optional `logger: ?*Logger = null` in its config. When non-null, automatic logging is active:

| Protocol | Methods called automatically | Config field |
| :- | :- | :- |
| HTTP | `access()` per request, `system()` lifecycle | `HttpServerConfig.logger` |
| HTTP/1.1 | `access()` per request, `system()` lifecycle | `Http1ServerConfig.logger` |
| HTTP/2 | `access()` per stream, `system()` lifecycle | `Http2ServerConfig.logger` |
| HTTP/3 | `access()` per request, `system()` lifecycle | `Http3ServerConfig.logger` |
| TCP | `conn()` on connection close, `system()` lifecycle | `TcpServerConfig.logger` |
| UDP | `packet()` per datagram, `system()` lifecycle | `UdpServerConfig.logger` |
| UDS | `system()` lifecycle | `UdsServerConfig.logger` |
| FIX | `session()` per message, `system()` lifecycle | `FixServerConfig.logger` |
| gRPC | `rpc()` per stream close, `system()` lifecycle | `GrpcServerConfig.logger` |
| Channel | no server config, call `logger.system()` manually | n/a |

`frame()` is available for manual use inside UDS handlers (the handler owns the stream, so frame-level events are caller-driven).

---

## Usage

```zig
fn createLogDir(io: std.Io) void {
    std.Io.Dir.cwd().createDirPath(io, "./logs") catch {};
}

pub fn main(process: std.process.Init) !void {
    createLogDir(process.io);

    var logger = try zix.Logger.init(std.heap.smp_allocator, .{
        .save_path      = "./logs",
        .save_file      = "app",
        .save_min_level = .INFO,
        .console        = .ALWAYS,
    });
    defer logger.deinit();

    // Manual lifecycle event
    logger.system(.INFO, "startup", "server starting on port {d}", .{9300});

    // Wire into server (automatic access/conn/packet/session logging)
    var server = try zix.Tcp.Server.init(myHandler, .{
        .io     = process.io,
        .ip     = "127.0.0.1",
        .port   = 9300,
        .logger = &logger,
    });
    defer server.deinit();
    try server.run();
}
```

## Examples

- `examples/udp_server.zig`
- `examples/uds_server.zig`
- `examples/http_basic.zig`
