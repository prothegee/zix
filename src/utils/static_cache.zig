//! zix static cache: resolved public_dir files kept open across requests.
//!
//! One table maps a resolved file path to an already-open file, its size, and a
//! prerendered HTTP/1.x 200 header, so a repeat request costs a hash lookup
//! instead of an open plus a stat. Precompressed .br and .gz siblings are
//! resolved once at insert and stored beside the identity file, so per-request
//! encoding negotiation is a table read rather than two speculative opens.
//!
//! The table is shared by every worker instead of living per worker, so a file
//! costs one descriptor for the process rather than one per worker. Reads are
//! lock-free: an insert publishes the slot key and then the live flag with
//! release ordering, and a reader takes a pin with an acquiring compare-and-swap
//! that only succeeds while the slot is live. Insert and reclaim hold a
//! spinlock.
//!
//! The cache never fails a request. A full table, an unreadable file, or a path
//! the caller must reject all return null, and the caller falls back to its own
//! uncached path. See ADR-064.
