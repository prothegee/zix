//! Where a local (unix-domain) socket lives, on every supported platform.
//!
//! What:
//!   A server and the client that talks to it must derive the exact same path, and that path
//!   must be one the platform will accept. POSIX takes a relative path happily. Windows does
//!   not: its AF_UNIX bind rejects a relative path outright, so the same relative string that
//!   works on Linux fails there.
//!
//! Note:
//! - The absolute path is the working directory plus the caller's relative directory. Both ends
//!   of a pair run from the same working directory, so both derive the same string with no
//!   shared state.
//! - The working directory comes from std.process.currentPath, not from resolving the opened
//!   directory handle. std.Io.Dir.realPath is unimplemented on NetBSD and OpenBSD (it returns
//!   error.OperationUnsupported there), which left both platforms unable to host a local socket
//!   at all. currentPath is backed by getcwd on every POSIX target and by ntdll on Windows.
//! - Windows has supported AF_UNIX since build 17063. On an older build std reports
//!   error.AddressFamilyUnsupported at bind time, which is the honest answer rather than a
//!   silent downgrade.
