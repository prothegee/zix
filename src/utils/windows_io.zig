//! Windows platform shims over ntdll for Windows targets: blocking socket I/O
//! plus the clock and secure-random fallbacks the engines need where std has no
//! portable path.
//!
//! What:
//! - The engine fast paths talk to sockets through raw POSIX descriptors. On
//!   Windows a socket is an AFD handle driven through ntdll (Zig 0.16 std does
//!   the same), so these helpers issue the AFD send, receive, poll, and
//!   partial-disconnect ioctls plus NtClose and NtCancelIoFileEx, each
//!   completed through its own event, for the thread dispatch models.
//! - The plain NtReadFile / NtWriteFile path is NOT used: raw AFD endpoints
//!   (opened by std, not by Winsock) fail it with connection-abort statuses.
//!   The ioctls here are the requests std itself issues for every socket
//!   read and write, so they are the proven path on these handles.
//! - Beyond sockets the file also carries two Windows-only fallbacks over the
//!   same ntdll surface: wallClockNs / monotonicUs (RtlGetSystemTimePrecise and
//!   the performance counter) and secureRandom (the CNG device).
//!
//! Note:
//! - Windows-only: every caller comptime-gates on builtin.os.tag == .windows,
//!   nothing here is analyzed on other targets.
//! - Best-effort semantics match the POSIX loops these back: any failed status
//!   maps to error.BrokenPipe, shutdown and close ignore failures.

// the layout (stable public knowledge, unchanged since Windows 2000).
//
// The poll ioctl is issued on a separate, bare AFD handle, never on the
// socket handle being watched: the socket's own handle goes inside the
// request as the watched Handle, matching every known implementation of
// this ioctl (wepoll, the pre-Vista mswsock provider). A self-submitted
// poll never completes, which is why the first cut of this gate hung.
//
// The request's own Timeout field is set to effectively never (matching
// wepoll's INT64_MAX), the timeout enforced here instead: the wait below
// carries the real deadline, and an expired wait cancels the still-pending
// poll request rather than trusting the kernel to complete it on its own.
// A second cut trusted that field and hung the exact same way as the
// self-submitted poll: proof it does not fire a completion by itself.
