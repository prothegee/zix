//! zix jzon serialize, the emitter generated from the type.
//!
//! What:
//! - Turns a typed value into JSON with the shape of the type resolved at compile
//!   time. Every object key, its quotes, its colon and the comma before it are
//!   baked into one literal, so a field costs one fixed-size copy plus its value.
//! - Two axes are picked by the caller: how integers reach the buffer, and how
//!   strings are scanned for the bytes that need escaping. They are independent,
//!   so every pairing is available.
//!
//! Note:
//! - The output matches `std.json.Stringify` byte for byte, whichever pairing is
//!   chosen. That is what makes a strategy a cost decision and nothing else.
//! - A field type with no JSON form is a compile error naming the type. It is
//!   never a runtime failure, and the std-backed path stays available for it.
//! - Writes land as they are produced, so a value that runs out of room leaves
//!   what fit behind. A caller that needs all-or-nothing keeps its own mark.
