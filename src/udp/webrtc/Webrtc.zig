//! zix.Webrtc namespace: a pure-Zig WebRTC data channel server on one UDP port.
//!
//! What:
//! - Re-exports the public surface: the Server type (Server.init(handler, config)), the event and
//!   message shapes, the context a handler replies through, the server config, and the shared
//!   DispatchModel. ICE, DTLS, SCTP, and DCEP are internal.
//! - One port carries all of it, demultiplexed by the first byte of each datagram (RFC 7983 7).
//!
//! Note:
//! - zix answers, it does not dial. The ICE agent is lite (RFC 8445 2.3) and the DTLS role is
//!   always server, which is what decides the stream identifiers a channel may open on
//!   (RFC 8832 6).
//! - Media is not carried yet. RTP and RTCP are routed to their own layer and dropped there, and
//!   answering them is a later pass.
