//! zix WebRTC DTLS session: the per-peer sequencer around the DTLS 1.2 server handshake.
//!
//! What:
//! - src/tls/dtls_connection.zig holds the three handshake steps as pure functions. Nothing there
//!   knows what order they run in, which datagram a message arrived in, or when a flight that went
//!   unanswered has to go out again. This file is that part, for one peer.
//! - Driven entirely by the caller: datagrams in, datagrams out, and a clock the caller owns.
//!   Nothing here touches a socket.
//!
//! Note:
//! - The cookie exchange keeps no state, which is the point of it (RFC 6347 4.2.1). A
//!   HelloVerifyRequest is therefore queued but never retransmitted on a timer: the answer to a
//!   lost one is the client's own retransmitted ClientHello, which is recomputed into the same
//!   cookie.
//! - The last flight is kept buffered even after the handshake finishes. The side that sent it
//!   owes a retransmission for as long as it keeps the association, or a lost final flight leaves
//!   both ends waiting (RFC 6347 4.2.4).
//! - A flight is handed out in path-sized pieces split on record boundaries, never mid-record. A
//!   record split across two datagrams is one no peer can open.
