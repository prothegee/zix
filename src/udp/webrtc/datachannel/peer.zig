//! zix WebRTC data channels over one SCTP association (RFC 8831, RFC 8832).
//!
//! What:
//! - The driver: open a channel, carry messages both ways, close a channel, and answer the peer
//!   doing any of the same. Everything below it is codecs and tables, and this is the file that
//!   decides when each one runs.
//! - Driven entirely by the caller, like the association under it. Packets in, packets out, and
//!   a clock the caller owns. Nothing here touches a socket or a timer.
//!
//! Note:
//! - Which identifiers this endpoint may open on comes from the DTLS role, so the role has to be
//!   the one the handshake actually took. Guessing it opens every channel on identifiers the peer
//!   owns, and a correct peer refuses all of them (RFC 8832 6).
//! - A channel this endpoint opened is reported open when the peer's DATA_CHANNEL_ACK arrives. If
//!   the peer's first user message overtakes that acknowledgement, which an unordered channel
//!   allows, the message is delivered and the channel is open from then on, with the message
//!   itself as the notification.
//! - Closing a channel takes two stream resets, one each way (RFC 8831 6.7), so a close is not
//!   finished until the peer has reset its own outgoing stream too. The identifier is only free
//!   for reuse after that, which is why it is released when the close is reported and not when
//!   it is asked for.
//! - A close the peer refuses leaves the channel unusable and its identifier retired, because
//!   reusing an identifier whose sequence numbering was never reset attaches the next channel's
//!   messages to the old one. Asking again is the caller's call, and calling `closeChannel` a
//!   second time is what re-arms it.
//! - Anything malformed closes one channel, never the association. An unreadable
//!   DATA_CHANNEL_OPEN, a payload identifier this endpoint does not carry, and user data on a
//!   stream with no channel are all channel-level faults (RFC 8831 6.6, RFC 8832 6).
