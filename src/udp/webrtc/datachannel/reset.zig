//! zix WebRTC data channel stream reset driver (RFC 6525 5, RFC 8831 6.7).
//!
//! What:
//! - The half of RFC 6525 a data channel actually uses: ask the peer to let one stream go back to
//!   sequence zero, answer the same ask coming the other way, and keep the request numbering
//!   straight in both directions.
//!
//! Note:
//! - Exactly one request may be outstanding at a time (RFC 6525 5.1.1). A second one is refused
//!   here rather than queued, because the layer above already knows which channels are waiting to
//!   close and can ask again on its next turn.
//! - One request names one stream. The wire form allows a list and this reader accepts one, since
//!   a peer may batch. Sending one at a time keeps the outstanding request tied to a single
//!   channel, which is what makes an answer unambiguous.
//! - A RE-CONFIG chunk is not carried by a TSN, so it can overtake DATA chunks that are still
//!   being retransmitted. That is why RFC 6525 5.2.2 E2 exists: a reset whose Sender's Last
//!   Assigned TSN is ahead of what has arrived is held, answered "In progress", and performed
//!   once the gap closes. Without that hold, closing a channel drops the last message sent on it.
//! - A repeat of a request already answered gets the same answer again and is not performed twice
//!   (RFC 6525 5.2.1). A retransmitted request looks exactly like a new one otherwise.
//! - An Incoming SSN Reset request is answered "Denied". RFC 8831 6.7 closes a channel by
//!   resetting the sender's own outgoing stream, so a peer asking this endpoint to reset its
//!   outgoing stream is not part of a data channel close, and a clear refusal is better than a
//!   partial implementation of a path nothing here takes.
//! - An SSN/TSN reset is not answered at all. Performing one means rewinding both TSN counters
//!   mid-association, which nothing in this stack can do, and there is no reader for it here.
