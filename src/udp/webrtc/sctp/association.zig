//! zix SCTP association (RFC 9260 4, 5, 9, over DTLS per RFC 8261).
//!
//! What:
//! - The state machine that ties the rest of this directory together: the four-way handshake,
//!   the data flow with its acknowledgements and retransmissions, and the graceful close.
//! - One object per association, driven entirely by the caller: packets in, packets out, and a
//!   clock the caller owns. Nothing here touches a socket or a timer.
//!
//! Note:
//! - The responder keeps NO state until a COOKIE ECHO comes back. Everything the INIT carried
//!   goes into the signed cookie, which is what makes a flood of INITs cost one hash each
//!   (RFC 9260 5.1.3).
//! - The verification tag is checked on every packet except the ones that cannot carry it yet.
//!   Getting this wrong is the difference between an association and an open port: a packet
//!   with the wrong tag is not from this peer (RFC 9260 8.5).
//! - Acknowledgements go out at once rather than being delayed. Always correct, and one packet
//!   per data packet rather than one per two. Delayed acknowledgement is a policy the layer
//!   above can add, and it needs a timer this file deliberately does not have.
//! - Stream sequence numbers are assigned here, one counter per outbound stream. TSNs are
//!   assigned by the send queue, which is the only thing that knows what is still outstanding.
//! - Fragmentation is by path maximum. A message larger than one packet becomes a run of chunks
//!   with the same stream sequence number, and RFC 9260 forbids interleaving another message
//!   into that run.
