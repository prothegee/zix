//! zix WebRTC server config.
//!
//! What:
//! - `WebrtcServerConfig`: the UDP substrate knobs restated flat (ADR-049 / ADR-050 contract) plus
//!   what the four protocol layers need to answer a peer: ICE credentials, the DTLS certificate and
//!   signing key, and the deadlines the engine runs on.
//!
//! Note:
//! - The TLS context is the sanctioned by-pointer exception, the same as every other zix engine
//!   that carries one: the caller owns it and it must outlive the server. WebRTC only reads its
//!   certificate and its signing key, and that key has to be ECDSA P-256, because the one DTLS 1.2
//!   suite this engine implements is ECDHE-ECDSA (RFC 5289).
//! - Every duration is milliseconds, because every layer below already counts in milliseconds.
