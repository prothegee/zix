// URING model: shared-nothing io_uring, one ring + listener per worker (ADR-037).
// Minimal correct core: multishot accept, an fd-indexed slot table with a
// generation-tagged user_data against fd reuse, a fixed per-connection recv
// buffer with a plain recv SQE (data lands directly in conn.buf, zero copy),
// one coalesced send per readable batch, and a batched CQE drain. Half-duplex
// per connection (at most one recv or one send in flight), so a blocking sink
// flush can never interleave with an in-flight send.
//
// 1. ring setup flags (SINGLE_ISSUER | DEFER_TASKRUN): measured null on the
//    12-core loopback box, but the reference ring engines run with them at
//    scale, so they are applied here behind a kernel-version probe with a
//    flagless fallback (initUringRing). Costless where the kernel lacks them,
//    and matches the reference engines' single-issuer fast path otherwise.
// 2. multishot recv + provided buffer ring: REVERTED, a regression. It forces a
//    memcpy from the kernel-selected buffer into conn.buf for accumulation, and
//    that copy (largest at pipeline depth 16) outweighs the multishot re-arm
//    saving the plain recv-into-conn.buf path avoids by receiving in place.

/// from EPOLL's 64 KiB saves 48 KiB/conn, which is critical for memory limits
